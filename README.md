# UnitSubclassify

My GUI for sub-classification of single units by cell-type, working on data stored in my [MultipleUnits/SingleUnit](https://github.com/edmerix/NeuroClass) objects. [Screenshots below](#screenshots).

It is semi-automatic, making use of the mean-autocorrelation lag (within 100 ms) of each unit (_AC lag_), the spike full-width at half-maximum (_FWHM_), delay from the spike valley to its following peak (_VtoP_), and the firing rate (_FR_).

You can set it to use any combination of these metrics for the automatic clustering (by default it uses all), and the plots simultaneously show the overall clustering results, and the clustering results when using just pairs of metrics.

Note that I remain skeptical about cell-type subclassifications in (human) neocortical recordings, as a major component of traditional classification is the spike shape â€“ a feature which is heavily biased by the electrode tip's position on the cell's axo-dendritic axis [(Gold _et al_., 2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467426). This relationship tends to automatically separate units by cell type in regions such as the hippocampus with its neat layers, just by their position relative to the recording electrode, whereas the neocortex is a bit less neatly structured...

That said, there have been some convincing subclassifications in human neocortical recordings that show physiologically plausible activity by cell type [(Peyrache _et al_., 2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22307639).

<sub><sup>(Also, a subset of pyramidal cells have been shown to have spike half-widths that are typically thought of as a feature of fast-spiking interneurons [(Vigneswaran _et al_., 2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976508), however this may be limited to the relatively rare Betz cells in M1.)</sup></sub>

## Dependencies

It is designed to be used with my [MultipleUnits/SingleUnit](https://github.com/edmerix/NeuroClass) objects, though the data structure could easily be mimicked without using those classes.

Beyond that, it depends on 3 (fairly standard) Matlab toolboxes:
- Stats
- Curve fitting
- Signal processing

## Usage

```Matlab
% where data = %MultipleUnits instance%

app = UnitSubclassify(data,'setting_name','setting_value');
